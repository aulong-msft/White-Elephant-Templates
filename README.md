# Gift Exchange Event Guidelines

## Sending Survey and Email to Interested Participants

1. **Create Survey**: Develop a Microsoft Form requesting participant name, email, and interest in the gift exchange. Utilize the 'White Elephant Survey' template or customize it to suit our needs.
   
   - Ensure to update names and dates according to the event.
   
2. **Email Template**: Use the provided email template, customized with updated information, to send out the survey to potential participants.

3. **Schedule Meeting**: Once suitable timings for all are identified, send a meeting invite for an approximate 2-hour duration.

## Setting up the PowerPoint Presentation

1. **Instructions for Participants**: Ask interested individuals to provide their name and a picture of the gift they intend to bring.

### Updating Ice Breaker Questions

- Edit Slide 2 with ice breaker questions to make them more engaging and suitable for the group.

### Updating PowerPoint with Gifts
The powerpoint is pre-populated with 18 gifts from a  previous gift exchange, ensure the extras are removed, or add new ones (guidance below)!

- Remove any additional gifts or add new ones as needed.
- Update the picture and name of each gift on the relevant slides.
     - Behind the gift picture on slide 4 (the gift picture is hidden underneath the present picture)
     - Behind the gift box picture on whichever slide that gift is shown, this is also where the name of the gift will be updated.
     - Then in the list on powerpoint slide 4 add the name of the original gift giver, that way they know which gift is theirs! Since this exchange is virtual, we need to make some expectation on who actually owns which gift.


### Adding a New Gift and Linking to a Slide

1. Duplicate a previous slide containing animations.
2. Insert a unique picture of a new gift.
3. Update Slide 4 with a smaller image and relevant text for the new gift.
4. Set the hyperlink to the corresponding slide.

### Animations for Gift Disappearance

1. Access the Selection Pane to rename and reorder objects for animation.
2. Apply a fade animation to make gifts disappear on click.
