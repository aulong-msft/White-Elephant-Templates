# Gift Exchange Event Guidelines

## Sending Survey and Email to Interested Participants

- **Create Survey**: Develop a Microsoft Form requesting participant name, email, and interest in the gift exchange. Utilize the 'White Elephant Survey' template or customize it to suit our needs.
   
   - Ensure to update names and dates according to the event.
   
- **Email Template**: Use the provided email template, customized with updated information, to send out the survey to potential participants.
- **Schedule Meeting**: Once suitable timings for all are identified, send a meeting invite for an approximate 2-hour duration.

## Setting up the PowerPoint Presentation

- **Instructions for Participants**: Ask interested individuals to provide their name and a picture of the gift they intend to bring.

### Updating Ice Breaker Questions

- Edit Slide 2 with ice breaker questions to make them more engaging and suitable for the group.

### Updating PowerPoint with Gifts
The powerpoint is pre-populated with 18 gifts from a  previous gift exchange, ensure the extras are removed, or add new ones (guidance below)!

- Remove any additional gifts or add new ones as needed.
- Update the picture and name of each gift on the relevant slides.
     - Behind the gift picture on slide 4 (the gift picture is hidden underneath the present picture)
     - Behind the gift box picture on whichever slide that gift is shown, this is also where the name of the gift will be updated.
     - Then in the list on powerpoint slide 4 add the name of the original gift giver, that way they know which gift is theirs! Since this exchange is virtual, we need to make some expectation on who actually owns which gift.


### Adding a New Gift and Linking to a Slide

- Duplicate a previous slide containing animations.
- Then add a unique picture of a present
- On slide 4 add a smaller picture of that present and the text next to it.
- Set the Hyperlink by selecting the picture you want to add the hyperlink to
- Go to the "Insert" tab on the PowerPoint ribbon.
- Click on "Link" or "Action" (the wording may vary depending on your PowerPoint version).
- In the dialog box that appears, choose "Hyperlink to" and then select "Slide...".
- Choose the slide you want to link to and click "OK".

### Animations for Gift Disappearance

- On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click "Select" and then click "Selection Pane".
- The Selection Pane will open on the right side of the screen and will display a list of all the objects on the current slide in the order they were inserted.
- Rename the to present x and drag it in present order at the top of the list to keep track of this image for the animation to make it dissapear (note alphabetical order is not a feature *tear*)
- Once the present is selected go to animation -> choose "fade" under "exit"
- Then ensure "Onclick" is selcted with duration 00.05
- Next to this click on the tigger icon -> "On click of" then choose present x from previous step.
