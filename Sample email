Hello everyone!

I will be hosting a White Elephant Gift Exchange this year for the Security and DevOps Tech Domains! If you are interested in participating please fill out this form

https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0bwWvg_uTtCtunqZLQJGKBUNFpKT1Y5WEJCMlFSMDhOREo4TUpOVlpYNy4u by December 6th!

 

What is white elephant?

A white elephant game is a popular party game that is often played during the holidays. The goal of the game is to exchange gifts with others in order to end up with the best gift possible.

Each player brings one wrapped gift to the party, and the gifts are placed in a central location.

Players then take turns choosing a gift, unwrapping it, and showing it to the other players.

If a player likes the gift, they can keep it. Otherwise, they can “steal” another player’s gift or choose a new one from the pile. The game continues until all gifts have been opened.

White elephant games are usually characterized by their light-hearted nature and lack of seriousness.
